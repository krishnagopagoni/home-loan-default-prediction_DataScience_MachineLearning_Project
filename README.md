Home Loan Default Prediction System
Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning application designed to predict whether a customer is likely to default on a home loan.
It covers data analysis, model training, evaluation, and deployment using a simple web-based interface.

The trained model is deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to upload a test dataset and receive loan default predictions along with probability scores.

Problem Statement

Loan defaults pose a significant financial risk to banking institutions.
The objective of this project is to:

Analyze customer financial and credit data

Build a predictive model to identify high-risk loan applicants

Provide a batch prediction interface for real-world use

Dataset Description

The dataset is derived from the Home Credit loan default dataset and includes the following files:

application_train.csv – Main dataset containing the target variable

bureau.csv and bureau_balance.csv – Credit history from other institutions

previous_application.csv – Historical loan applications

POS_CASH_balance.csv – POS and cash loan history

credit_card_balance.csv – Credit card usage history

installments_payments.csv – Repayment behavior

Target Variable:

0 – Non-Defaulter

1 – Defaulter

Machine Learning Approach

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature engineering

Handling class imbalance

Model training using Random Forest Classifier

Model evaluation

Probability-based decision making

A custom business threshold of 0.30 is applied instead of the default 0.50 to better handle the imbalanced nature of the dataset.
